R-code for Figure 2 and algebraic derivations for an article titled: "Required Liquidty and Lobbying: Large Versus Small Banks"

by Oz Shy and Rune Stenbacka.

The R-code draws Figure 2 in the paper (lobbying outcomes under unequal lobbying costs).

All derivations for the above article can be found on liquid_2024_x_y.pdf (which the reader can download). The reader can then scroll down to the desired derivation using the same section, subsection, and equation numbers correspoding to the paper itself. 

The above PDF file was constructed from a symbolic algebra software called "Derive for Windows." The file liquid_2024_x_y.dfw requires this sofware, so it is sufficient for the reader to download only on the above PDF.
